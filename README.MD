  <h2 align="center"> Live Action Map (LAM) </h2>

  <p align="center">
    An attempt to use open source data on Twitter to map areas with active conflict. Right now it is used for the Ukraine-Russia conflict, but in the future I hope it can be used for all sorts of dangerous situations.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There are many twitter accounts posting live tweets about locations with conflicts. However, it is difficult to keep track of the locations especially with multiple different sources pointing out different location every few minutes. To make sure people can stay safe and take care of themselves, I have aggregated all the tweets into a single map that is easily accessible.

This project is a work in progress. I am working on adding more features and improving the map.

![Alt text](./images/map.PNG)

How it works:
 * Tweets are sourced using keywords, hashtags and prepositions, such as the phrase "shooting... near ... location".
 * Tweets can also be sourced from known twitter accounts by passing their usernames.
 * Tweets are parsed with NLP and the location is extracted from the tweet, this however is not perfect so we need to filter locations later on.
 * Some tweets might talk about other countries reactions like "The US.." or "Russia.." or "Moscow..", in that case we remove all the locations that are not in Ukraine.
 * Some tweets might talk about multiple locations like "Shooting near the location and the location". In that case both locations are added to the map.  Multiple markers can be added to the same location.
 * Finally we add markers for each tweet. 
 * Markers will cluster together when you zoom out.
 * A single marker looks like a red pin on a map.
 * A cluster appears as a circle with a number inside it, the color shifts from green to orange to red depending on the number of markers in the cluster.
 * We are not taking data directly because that may be vulnerable to trolling and spamming.
 * We are using the Twitter v2 API to get the tweets, however it does not support parsing location directly from tweets.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3 (this project has support for [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) with the [python plugin](https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python))
* tweepy
* spaCy
* folium
* geopy
* tqdm
* geography3 (optional, needed for experimental feature)
* spaCy `en_core_web_sm` model

### Installation

1. Get a free twitter API Key from [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api). Remember to create a new app and get the bearer key.
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kinshukdua/LiveActionMap.git
   ```
3. Install all prerequisites
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Download model used with spaCy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```
4. Open scrape.py and change the bearer key to your own.
   ```python
   bearer_token = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   ```
